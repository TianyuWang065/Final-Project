"Let's talk about invisible darlings.  Who probably think they haven¡¯t been seen all year.  Who puts a foot inside a door to keep it open? Who worked all night so we could have our celebrating cheer?  If you¡¯re wondering if you¡¯ll ever be noticed.  If you're worried that you¡¯ll be left behind. Ive been trying to write a song that can¡¯t ignore you.  My heart can range the distance that¡¯s between us.  And your heart is my guiding light.  We¡¯ll meet there.  
Too often we are our villains and our heroes.  Save ourselves and then we dig ourselves a fresh tomb.  I¡¯m searching for the invisible darlings.  Their gifts might be the best things all year.  To be or be the thing that gets the crushing. To be or be left behind.  To be or truly figure out the center note.  My heart can range the distance thats between us and your heart is my guiding light.  We¡¯ll meet there.  
Darling, you can beat it.  You can beat the thing that eats you.  Before it eats you.  Drives you crazy.  Theres no hope in all the stats and all the ¡°winning""
